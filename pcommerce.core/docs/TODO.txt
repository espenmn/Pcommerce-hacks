To do
=====


Customers
---------

Membership integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integrate order form with site membership, or don't require membership?

The payment process should be easier for customers, now lots of duplicate 
data have to be filled in.

Product filtering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Filter on product properties to narrow down products (ajax?)


Vendor
------

Order management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* batching

* filtering (on status, for example)

* Integrate processing here? The current way is rather flimsy: vendor clicks a
  link from an email which takes him to the processOrder page, which redirects
  to a blank page displaying only "order processed".

  - First step: processing should redirect to `@@manage-orders`, with a status
    message.


General
-------

* Layout: currently has own CSS looking like Plone 3. Try styling by adding
  only classes, so we use Plone's own styling (should work in both 3 and 4). 
* Translations: replace bare strings with labels and defaults
