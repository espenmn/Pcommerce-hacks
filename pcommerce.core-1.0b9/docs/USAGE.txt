Detailed setup
--------------

Thank you-page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The thank you-page may be left empty, in that case customers will be redirected
to the root of the site after checkout.

Folder view: "Shop"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "Shop" folder view shows "hot" and / or "new" products, if present.

Folder view: "ShopFolder"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "ShopFolder" view lists all products in the folder. Probably, this is what
you want for a simple shop.

Additional price
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An additional price can be added to a product. you can specify a period where it
is valid (Plone's dates). If the additional price X is lower than the default
price Y, it will display as "$ X (instead of $ Y)".

Order management
----------------

There's a management screen where you can see all orders and their statuses.
The link to the Order Management is available under the user actions, or you
can type `@@manage-orders` directly.

The view is protected by the "PCommerce: Manage Orders" permissions.
