Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        PCommerce (Plone commerce) provides a simple shop system which supports:
        
        * product variations
        * multiple prices per product to support special prices per user or group
          (over the sharing tab) and prices only available for a specific time
          (by using the expiration date)
        * multiple pluggable payment methods
        * multiple pluggable shipment methods
        * multiple taxes by zone
        * pre and post tax charges per payment and shipment method
        * component based checkout to easily customize the checkout process
        * multiple currencies by using Products.CurrencyUtility
        
        
        Pluggable Payment Methods
        -------------------------
        
        A payment plugin consists of a named adapter implementing
        pcommerce.core.interfaces.IPaymentMethod and named by the id (usually
        the package name) of the method and one or more views injecting data
        into the checkout process. The views are registered for the payment
        method and have to implement pcommerce.core.interfaces.IPaymentView.
        The name of the view corresponds to the name of the component where
        the data has to be injected (e.g. payment, confirmation, overview etc.).
        
        As an example of a simple payment plugin pcommerce.payment.invoice is
        available, which simply collects a billing address and injects it into
        the confirmation and order email.
        
        
        Pluggable Shipment Methods
        --------------------------
        
        A shipment plugin works much like a payment plugin, the only differences
        are the interfaces to be implemented by the adapter and the corresponding
        views, which there are pcommerce.core.interfaces.IShipmentMethod respectively
        pcommerce.core.interfaces.IShipmentView.
        
        As an example pcommerce.shipment.parcel is available, which collects a delivery
        address and injects it into the confirmation and order email.
        
        
        Optional dependencies
        ---------------------
        
        Products.CurrencyUtility - to add support for multiple currencies
        
        ImageTag_CorePatch - to add support for dynamic image scaling
        [http://www.zope.org/Members/bowerymarc/ImageTag_CorePatch/0.3/ImageTag_CorePatch.tgz]
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        * Install pcommerce.shipment.X and pcommerce.payment.Y
        
        * Via the control panel, go to PCommerce settings and modify:
        
          - Set taxes
        
          - Set "Terms and conditions"-page (required)
        
          - Set "Thank you"-page (optional, see below)
        
        * Add a folder, name it "My Webshop" (or something like that)
        
        * Add a product, give it a price
        
        * Set the folder's containing view to "ShopFolder"
        
        
        Detailed setup
        --------------
        
        Thank you-page
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The thank you-page may be left empty, in that case customers will be redirected
        to the root of the site after checkout.
        
        Folder view: "Shop"
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The "Shop" folder view shows "hot" and / or "new" products, if present.
        
        Folder view: "ShopFolder"
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The "ShopFolder" view lists all products in the folder. Probably, this is what
        you want for a simple shop.
        
        Additional price
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        An additional price can be added to a product. you can specify a period where it
        is valid (Plone's dates). If the additional price X is lower than the default
        price Y, it will display as "$ X (instead of $ Y)".
        
        Order management
        ----------------
        
        There's a management screen where you can see all orders and their statuses.
        The link to the Order Management is available under the user actions, or you
        can type `@@manage-orders` directly.
        
        The view is protected by the "PCommerce: Manage Orders" permissions.
        
        To do
        =====
        
        
        Customers
        ---------
        
        Membership integration
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Integrate order form with site membership, or don't require membership?
        
        The payment process should be easier for customers, now lots of duplicate 
        data have to be filled in.
        
        Product filtering
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Filter on product properties to narrow down products (ajax?)
        
        
        Vendor
        ------
        
        Order management
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * batching
        
        * filtering (on status, for example)
        
        * Integrate processing here? The current way is rather flimsy: vendor clicks a
          link from an email which takes him to the processOrder page, which redirects
          to a blank page displaying only "order processed".
        
          - First step: processing should redirect to `@@manage-orders`, with a status
            message.
        
        
        General
        -------
        
        * Layout: currently has own CSS looking like Plone 3. Try styling by adding
          only classes, so we use Plone's own styling (should work in both 3 and 4). 
        * Translations: replace bare strings with labels and defaults
